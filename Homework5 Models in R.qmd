## Task One: Conceptual Questions

### Question One: What is the purpose of using cross-validation when fitting a random forest model?

### Question Two: Describe the bagged tree algorithm.

### Question Three: What is meant by a general linear model?

### Question Four: When fitting a multiple linear regression model, what does adding an interaction term
do? That is, what does it allow the model to do differently as compared to when it is
not included in the model?

### Question Five: Why do we split our data into a training and test set?


## Task Two: Data Prep

### Packages and data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("tidymodels")
library("caret")
library("yardstick")

heartdata <- read.csv("heart.csv")
```

```{r}
